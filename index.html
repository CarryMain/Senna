            <div class="text-one">Bonaparte is my ginger Persian cat. He is 7 years old, he is a very intelligent and proud cat. He walks elegantly, holds his tail straight and high in the air. Well, his name is Bonaparte. And it’s not strange that he behaves like an emperor. But I just call him Bonya and he is my best friend.

                Bonya is an active cat. He likes playing, hunting and running. I bought him a lot of cat toys, but he prefers hunting flies, spiders and sunbeams. I don’t mind, because it is also an interesting and useful activity. After the hunt, Bonya wants to eat. I give him meat, chicken or fish. He doesn’t like sausages, milk, sour cream and etc. This is not the emperor’s food. Steak from meat and fish is the real emperor’s food. Bonaparte thinks so.</div>
